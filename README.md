# Temperature Predictor
## How it Works
This Program uses a Machine Learning Algorithm called Decision Tree Regression to learn from over 1,500,000 data entries 
collected over 20 years across 148 cities and 64 countries to create a complex and accurate model to predict the temperature of any 
city at any given day of the year.
